# Phoenix LiveView Examples
### May 18, 2019

[LiveView](https://github.com/phoenixframework/phoenix_live_view)
for [Phoenix](https://github.com/phoenixframework/phoenix) on [Elixir](https://github.com/elixir-lang/elixir) is definitely scratching an itch
in the world of rich client apps, without having to go full-on
client-side framework.  Here's a list of open
source projects, some with online demos and other where you can
(easily) run the code locally.

Sometimes it's best to learn by examples, here goes.
