### May 18, 2019

Letâ€™s welcome LiveView to the Elixir Phoenix ecosystem. Wanted: rich user experience, JavaScript frameworks need not apply.

Despite being very (very) new come learn more about some common user interface features that can be solved with LiveView, and some lessons learned along the way to refactoring away from custom JavaScript and towards LiveView controllers.

Here is the actual talk from [Empex 2019](https://empex.co) from May 2019.
